DB Replication:

CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation

WHat are we sending:

1. naive implementation: send the sql strings to the replica.
2. Write Ahead Log: same as above but while maintaining a log file.

disadvantanges: running query involves multiple steps like execution plan and executing according to it. We don't want to do the other DB these same steps again.

Binary Streaming Replication: Send the Data / output of the query execution to other DB. Convert the data to binary and stream the data to other DB.

Logical Replication: Implemented in PostgreSQL

Sychronous Replication: Whenever write - write to all the DBs - till all the DBs return yes, it'll not return back with success.

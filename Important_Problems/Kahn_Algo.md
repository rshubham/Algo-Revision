**Important Points**

    + A graph should be Directed Acyclic Graph for the Topological sort to be found.
    + A DAG will always have a node with In-Degree = 0 and another node with Out-Degree = 0.
    + Longest Path b/w 2 nodes in a DAG is finite.
    + Example: 1 --> 2 --> 3, Node 1: In-Degree = 0; Node 3: Out-Degree = 0; Longest Path = 2(finite).
